# libft
libft is a CODAM assignment (part of 42 network). 
This project is about understanding the way standard functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. To do this we write our own 
library of basic c functions to use and expand in later projects.
All funcrtions are compiled into a .a library file with the use of a 
Makefile.

### Beware
This repository is NOT in line with the assignment in terms that I have added new functions to it and the bonus is not seperatly added as in the original assignment.

### Requirements
The functions are written in C and require compiling with GCC or CLANG. 

### Instructions
You can use the added Makefile to compile the library.

## Testing
To test this file you can either write an own test main (recommended) or use the [francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette) tester as a quick check.
